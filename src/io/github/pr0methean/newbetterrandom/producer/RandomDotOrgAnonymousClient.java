/**
 * <p>Connects to <a href="https://www.random.org/clients/http/" target="_top">random.org's old
 * API</a> (via HTTPS) and downloads a set of random bits to use as seed data.  It is generally
 * better to use the {@link DevRandomSeedGenerator} where possible, as it should be much quicker.
 * This seed generator is most useful on Microsoft Windows without Cygwin, and other platforms that
 * do not provide {@literal /dev/random} (or where that device is very slow).</p>
 * <p>Random.org collects randomness from atmospheric noise using 9 radios, located at undisclosed
 * addresses in Dublin and Copenhagen and tuned to undisclosed AM/FM frequencies. (The secrecy is
 * intended to help prevent tampering with the output using a well-placed radio transmitter, and the
 * use of AM/FM helps ensure that any such tampering would cause illegal interference with
 * broadcasts and quickly attract regulatory attention.)</p>
 * <p>Random.org has two APIs: an <a href="https://www.random.org/clients/http/">old API</a> and a
 * <a href="https://api.random.org/json-rpc/1/">newer JSON-RPC API</a>. Since the new one requires
 * a key provided to each user by random.org, a client for the old one is still useful for
 * anonymous access. However, if you have a key, you can instead use {@link RandomDotOrgApi2Client}.
 * </p>
 * <p>Note that when using the old API, random.org limits the supply of free random numbers to any
 * one IP address; if you operate from a fixed address (at least if you use IPv4), you can <a
 * href="https://www.random.org/quota/">check
 * your quota and buy more</a>. On the new API, the quota is per key rather than per IP, and
 * commercial-use pricing follows a <a href="https://api.random.org/pricing">different
 * scheme</a>.</p>
